It is an AI game build using deep learning and pygame. It is based on utilisation of Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies(NEAT) algorithm. This algorithm helps to train the AI by making simultaneous copies of itself at an initial level and then learn from each AI bird. This process keeps on running which is what we call evolution. The AI evolves itself to make itself better.
